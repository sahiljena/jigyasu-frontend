## 💡 Inspiration
JigYasu is an  One stop web platform portal which will contain all the information about all academic activities of different universities spanning across the country and the international arena in chronological order.


## 💻 What it does
It is a multiservice platform which benefits one on all the stages, i.e from registration to earning the certificate; we have covered it all!
All the events portrayed on the portal will be authenticated by checking the authorization of the host.
The portal will be capable of handling all the workshops and seminars conducted across the country, universities and international arena.
This portal allows peer- participants to get connected thereby creating a community.
According to the participants’ interests, they will be notified about the upcoming events and webinars through mails.
It also serves as a platform for the universities to promote their event and showcase themselves on an international platform
